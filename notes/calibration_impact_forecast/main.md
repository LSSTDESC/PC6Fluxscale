# StarDICE run 3: simulation and performance forecasts

*Marc Betoule*

A very brief description of your paper, for the folder's README. (Once you've typed this, you'll be asked for three more items:  the project repo name, a serial number (just choose 0000, it'll get changed later), and a short title (that doesn't contain the repo name). These will then be used to set the paper's folder name, for you to accept or modify. Finally, you'll be asked to choose your Note's format, from [tex/apj/mnras/prl/prd/ipynb/md/rst]. You can always change your mind later, and it's easy to convert a tex Note into a journal paper with the start_paper make command.

# Appendix: LSST DESC Notes `Markdown` Reference

You can delete all of this whenever you're ready.

## Introduction

This is a template [`Markdown`](https://github.com/adam-p/Markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) LSST DESC Note, for you to adapt for
your own work.

## Sectioning

As you can see above, your content can easily be divided into sections.
You can also make subsections, as follows.

### A Subsection

You can even have subsubsections, like this:

#### A Subsubsection

See? This is a subsubsection.

#### Another Subsubsection

And so is this.

### Another Subsection

And so on.

Math
----

You can typeset mathematics using latex commands like this:

$$\langle f(k) \rangle = \frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}$$

While this does not render on GitHub, it should get [picked up by
Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/math.html) later and
will be available for you to re-use in future latex documents.

Code
----

You can show code in blocks like this:

```python
print "Hello World"
```

or this:

```bash
echo "Hello World"
```

Inline mentions of code `objects` can be made using pairs of backquotes.

## Figures

To add figures, add the required image file (PNG, SVG or JPG preferred)
to the `figures` subdirectory in your Note's folder. Here's an example:

![](./figures/example.jpg)
This is the figure caption: above we have the LSST DESC logo, in JPG format.

And then the text continues. Note that GitHub ignores the image sizing
commands when presenting [`Markdown`](https://github.com/adam-p/Markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format documents; Sphinx might not.

## Tables

Tables can be fiddly in [`Markdown`](https://github.com/adam-p/Markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). A good place to start is an online table generator like [this one](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/Markdown_tables). Then, you'll need some patience. For more on table formatting, see the [`Markdown` cheat-sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/Markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables).

|   A   |   B   |      C         |  D  |
|:-----:|:-----:|:--------------:|:---:|
| (deg) | (kpc) | ($M_{\odot}$)  |     |
|  0.4  |  3.4  |  $10^{12.2}$   | R,S |
|  9.6  |  8.2  |  $10^{10.4}$   |  S  |


## References

You can cite papers (or anything else) by providing hyperlinks. For
example, you might have been impressed by the DESC White Paper [(LSST
Dark Energy Science Collaboration
2012)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0310). It should be possible to convert
these links to latex citations automatically later.
